# Class for authenticating users.
#
# One of the benefits of using jupyterhub, is its ability to use a central
# Identity Provider and Authentication service.
#
#  Currently installed:
#    - default: jupyterhub.auth.PAMAuthenticator
#    - dummy: jupyterhub.auth.DummyAuthenticator
#    - null: jupyterhub.auth.NullAuthenticator
#    - pam: jupyterhub.auth.PAMAuthenticator
#  Default: 'jupyterhub.auth.PAMAuthenticator'
#
# Also, check the OAuth authenticators, at:-
#  https://oauthenticator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/provider-specific-setup/index.html
#
# The 'dummy' authenticator will allow any user to login and launch a jupyter
# notebook, so should definitely NOT BE USED in production or on publicly
# accessible servers!
c.JupyterHub.authenticator_class = "dummy"

# The public facing URL of the whole JupyterHub application.
#
#          This is the address on which the proxy will bind.
#          Sets protocol, ip, base_url
#  Default: 'http://:8000'
# (dev note) This will be copied to c.Proxy.public_url
c.JupyterHub.bind_url = "https://hub.example.com"

# Whether to clean up the jupyterhub-managed traefik configuration
# when the Hub shuts down.
c.JupyterHub.cleanup_proxy = True

# The URL on which the Hub will listen. This is a private URL for internal
#  communication. Typically set in combination with hub_connect_url. If a unix
#  socket, hub_connect_url **must** also be set.
#
#  For example:
#
#      "http://127.0.0.1:8081"
#      "unix+http://%2Fsrv%2Fjupyterhub%2Fjupyterhub.sock"
#
#  .. versionadded:: 0.9
#  Default: ''
#
# jupyterhub_traefik_proxy will configure the 'service' url in traefik, so this
# needs to be accessible from traefik. By default, jupyterhub will bind to
# 'localhost', but this will bind jupyterhub to its container name
c.JupyterHub.hub_bind_url = "http://hub:8000"

# This sets traefik's router rule for routing traffic to the jupyterhub
# instance.
#
# Typically, you'll want a traefik Host-based configuration rule, e.g.:-
#   traefik.http.routers.jupyterhub.rule=Host(`hub.example.com`)
#
# The corresponding `hub_routespec` for the above would be:-
#   c.JupyterHub.hub_routespec = 'hub.example.com'
#
# The default is to bind to everything, creating a path-based rule. i.e.
#   traefik.http.routers.jupyterhub.rule=PathPrefix(`/`)
#
# Default: = '/'
#
c.JupyterHub.hub_routespec = "hub.example.com/"

# Set the log level by value or name.
#  Choices: any of [0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 'DEBUG', 'INFO', 'WARN', 'ERROR', 'CRITICAL']
#  Default: 30
#  See also: Application.log_level

c.TraefikFileProviderProxy.dynamic_config_file = "/var/run/traefik/jupyterhub.yaml"

# These must match traefik's dynamic configuration (check the labels in

# Traefik can automatically retrieve certificates for each user container from
# an ACME provider (e.g. Let's Encrypt), For an example, read the comments in
# traefik's static configuraiton file, traefik.yaml, and refer to the

#   https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/https/acme/

# The class to use for spawning single-user servers.
#
#  Currently installed:
#    - default: jupyterhub.spawner.LocalProcessSpawner
#    - localprocess: jupyterhub.spawner.LocalProcessSpawner
#    - simple: jupyterhub.spawner.SimpleLocalProcessSpawner
#  Default: 'jupyterhub.spawner.LocalProcessSpawner'
#
# Launch each user's notebook server in a separate container.
c.JupyterHub.spawner_class = "dockerspawner.DockerSpawner"

# Base Image to use for user notebook containers. You can build your own,
# or use an image name and tag from hub.docker.com, or another image repository
c.DockerSpawner.image = "jupyterhub/singleuser"

# Explicitly set notebook directory because we'll be mounting a host volume to
# it.  Most jupyter/docker-stacks *-notebook images run the Notebook server as
# user `jovyan`, and set the notebook directory to `/home/jovyan/work`.
# We follow the same convention.

# container
c.DockerSpawner.volumes = {"jupyterhub-user-{username}": notebook_dir}

# The docker network name that single-user notebook containers should attach to
c.DockerSpawner.network_name = "traefik_internal"

# For jupyterhub to let traefik manage certificates, 'ssl_cert' needs a
# value. (This gets around a validate rule on 'proxy.bind_url', which
# forces redirects to 'http', unless there is a value in ssl_cert).
# Otherwise, when logging in, there will always be 302 redirects to http://
c.JupyterHub.ssl_cert = "externally managed"

# jupyterhub will only configure path-based routing by default. To stop
# traefik from routing all requests to jupyterhub, a subdomain host should be
# configured.
# That is, by default, jupyterhub will create a router rule of just PathPrefix(`/`).
# This could conflict with other traefik router rules, or just be too easily
# accessible.
#
# If a subdomain_host is configured, each user container will be accessible at:-
#   https://<user>.<subdomain_host>
#
# e.g. A user of "jbloggs", logging into a hub with a subdomain_host of
# "https://hub.example.com", will be redirected to their notebook at
# https://jbloggs.hub.example.com
c.JupyterHub.subdomain_host = "https://hub.example.com"
